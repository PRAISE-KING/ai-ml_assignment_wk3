 1. Ethical Considerations
 Biases in the MNIST Model (Digit Classification)
While MNIST is relatively balanced and objective (digits 0–9), some ethical concerns include:

Underrepresentation of certain writing styles (e.g., left-handed digits, non-Western handwriting)

Overfitting to neat, clearly written digits — might fail on real-world digits written by children or elderly people

 Mitigation using TensorFlow Fairness Indicators:

Use Fairness Indicators to evaluate model performance across slices (e.g., handwriting from different age groups or cultural sources)

Monitor metrics like accuracy disparity, false positives, false negatives across subgroups

 Biases in the Amazon Reviews Model (spaCy + rule-based sentiment)
Rule-based methods can be oversimplified and biased towards:

Positive words in sarcastic context: “Great job breaking it, hero.”

Neglecting cultural language or slang (e.g., “bad” as a compliment)

 Mitigation using spaCy’s Custom Rules:

Expand positive/negative word lists with contextual synonyms

Use custom pipelines with spaCy to account for sarcasm or domain-specific words

Combine with ML-based sentiment classifiers for better generalization



 2. Troubleshooting Challenge: Fixing Buggy TensorFlow Code
 Example Buggy Code (Common Issues)
python
Copy
Edit
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)
🔍 Problem:
Using mean_squared_error for classification (not appropriate)

Might cause shape mismatch if y_train is one-hot encoded and predictions are raw logits

 Fixed Code:
python
Copy
Edit
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Correct loss for multi-class classification
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Ensure labels are one-hot encoded
y_train = to_categorical(y_train)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test)

# Proceed with training
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
