# 🤖 AI Tools Assignment: Mastering the AI Toolkit

This project demonstrates the use of **AI tools and frameworks** to solve practical machine learning and NLP problems while applying ethical principles in AI development. It includes both theoretical analysis and hands-on implementation using Python libraries such as **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **spaCy**, with a bonus **Streamlit deployment** of a digit classifier.
